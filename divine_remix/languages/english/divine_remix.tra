@10301 =~Silverstar of Selûne~
// this is the sphere-enabled kit description. Spheres will be added automatically via patching
@10302 =~SILVERSTAR OF SELÛNE: Selûne (pronounced: seh-loon-ay), Our Lady of Silver, is the goddess of the moon, the stars, and those who use them to navigate. Her eternal foe is the evil Shar, goddess of darkness, night, loss, and forgetfulness. Selûne is often called the Moonmaiden for her connection to the silver moon that orbits Faerun. She is the goddess of the moon and travelers. Selûne's home plane is The Gates of the Moon with her home a shining hall of silver called Argentil.

Non-evil lycanthropes honor Selûne as the master of their fate as do astrologers and fortune tellers. Selûne is also growing popular among alewives, laundresses, seamstresses and servants with the message of female empowerment. She is also worshiped by female spellcasters, navigators and sailors.

Selûne's clerics, called Silverstars of Selûne, are dedicated advocates of freedom and tolerance, wanderers on the path of truth and absolute foes of Shar. They seek to build harmony among lycanthropes and non-shapechangers, and they protect the weak and the oppressed everywhere. They cannot abide slavery, and they hate most undead. They rarely settle in one place for long, instead moving along when seized by wanderlust or enticed by a new cause or mission. They deal with lunar energies and phenomena and are, to a limited degree, able to wield the power of the moon, bringing its fierce, pure white light to Toril to advance the goddess's wishes.

Abilities:
- Spiritual Weapon: Mace - 'Moon's Hand' once per day
The Moon's Hand is the spiritual weapon of Silverstars of Selûne. It grants +2 bonus to AC while equipped and is wielded as if the caster had grand mastery in the weapon.

This spell summons forth a silent, weightless sword-like construct made of moonlight that extends four feet from the caster's hand. The moonblade is considered a +4 weapon for determining what creatures it can hit, though the bonus does not apply to attack rolls made with it. In addition, due to the insubstantial nature of the moonblade, melee bonuses from Strength do not apply.

The strike of a moonblade drains a target's vitality, inflicting 1d12+4 points of damage, plus an additional 1d12 points to undead, who are particularly susceptible. A successful strike also temporarily scrambles magic, causing any spells the target casts in the next round to fail.~

// iwdee bio
@10322 = ~Less than a fortnight after your initiation ceremony into the Temple of Selûne, you were summoned before the Silverbrow of your order. In warm words fitting for a follower of Our Lady of Silver, she gave you your first assignment as a member of the clergy: to travel to the frontier towns of the North and bring the guidance of the Moonmaiden to the people that make the harsh environments their home. Almost as an afterthought, she spoke to you of portents and omens concerning events transpiring in the North, and it was the belief of the temple that a representative of their interests there might serve to soothe potential troubles in the region.

Though these missions to the untamed wilderness are often considered an unwanted chore by the less optimistic members of your order, you found yourself eager to accept the task. It seemed to be a chance to bring hope and light to the people of the North, a chance to do some real good rather than settling into weekly services delivered for the temple’s casual worshipers in the city. Without hesitation, you agreed to make the pilgrimage, and within a tenday, you embarked on your journey North, with only a staff in hand and the wisdom of the Moonmaiden in your heart.~

@10602 =~NIGHTCLOAK OF SHAR: Shar is the goddess of darkness, night, loss, and forgetfulness. Her main aspect is worshipped by those who deal in the night (such as thieves), who hate the light (such as goblin races and their allies), and who feel bitterness and loss. Her symbol is a black disk with a border of deep purple.

Shar's mortal enemy is the goddess Selûne and the two fight on a number of levels throughout their immortal lives. There is a continual war between the two faiths and jihads against Selûne and her followers are common where Shar is strong.

Clerics of Shar are called Nightcloaks. They exist outside the standard church hierarchy. Shar has no main temple, but instead has a scattering of cells and secretive places throughout the Realms. The Nightcloaks of Shar serve as contacts, messengers, and enforcers of the Dark Lady's will.

@10902 =~BATTLEGUARD OF TEMPUS: Tempus is the Realms' god of war, the Lord of Battle, the Foehammer. He is random in his favors, yet his chaotic nature favors all sides equally. He may be on an army's side on one day and against them the next. Such is the nature of war as embodied by Tempus.

The dress of the Battleguard of Tempus is armor, battle-worn and battered. In more civilized regions this has been replaced by a steel skullcap, but the message is the same--these are warrior priests. Their place is in the trenches with the troops, urging them onwards. Battleguards of Tempus may be found on both sides of a conflict, as none can ever truly know who the war god will favor.

Battleguards of Tempus can only be of Chaotic Neutral, Chaotic Good, True Neutral, and Chaotic Evil alignments

Abilities:

Calling upon Tempus for endurance in adversity, the Battleguard becomes protected from most physical harm. When the spell is cast, it confers complete invulnerability to all weapons except for those of greater than +5 enchantment. This spell is incredibly powerful, hence the short duration. However the casting time is also very short making this spell incredibly useful in the thick of combat where buying a few seconds can mean the difference between life or death. This spell lasts for the duration or until dispelled.~

It is he who offers succor and calming words to those who are in pain, oppressed, or in great need. He is the willing sufferer, the one who takes the place of another to heft the other's burden, to take the other's pain. He is the god of the oppressed and unjustly treated. In early days Ilmater's symbol was a blood stained rack, but of late a set of white hands bound by a blood red cord is used. The latter symbol has increased Ilmater's popularity in the world at large. Ilmater dwells in the Twin Paradises.

The followers of Ilmater are often perceived as being intentional sufferers, but in reality they offer a great deal along the "pure clerical" nature of healing and recovery to those who have been hurt. They put others ahead of themselves, are sharing, and emphasize the spiritual nature of life over the gross material body. Ilmater's priests are found where they are needed, which is usually in the worst possible conditions, ministering to the needs of the oppressed, and the poor.

In plain words fitting for a follower of the Crying God, she gave you your first assignment as a member of the clergy: to travel to the frontier towns of the North and bring an end to the suffering to the people that make the harsh environments their home. Almost as an afterthought, she spoke to you of portents and omens concerning events transpiring in the North, and it was the belief of the temple that a representative of their interests there might serve to soothe potential troubles in the region.

Though these missions to the untamed wilderness are often considered an unwanted chore by the less optimistic members of your order, you found yourself eager to accept the task. It seemed to be a chance to bring hope and relief to the people of the North, a chance to do some real good rather than settling into weekly services delivered for the temple’s casual worshipers in the city. Without hesitation, you agreed to make the pilgrimage, and within a tenday, you embarked on your journey North, with only a staff in hand and the endurance of the Broken God in your heart.~

To maintain continued worship he does take a limited interest in his followers' mortal problems, and occasionally makes his presence known with a manifestation, but never an avatar.

Kossuth's church is varied and chaotic since he takes no interest in its structure. As a result it is a collection of cults with each faction coming up with its own ethics, codes, morals, and teachings. Kossuth's symbol varies greatly from faction to faction, but is generally a depiction of fire. It is believed that if Kossuth's following were to somehow become unified he would become a very powerful force in the Realms, something the other gods don't really wish to see happen. Of the four Elemental Lords, the best known and most feared are the cults of Kossuth, who are very powerful in Thay and the lands of the East.

Firewalkers of Kossuth can be of neutral alignment, but most are evil, reveling in the destructive power of fire. They can be members of any race. They dress in whatever their faction deems appropriate for the representation of their god. This is usually robes and long capes in reds, yellows, and oranges.

Calling upon his deity's blazing touch, the Firewalker channels some of Kossuth's searing energy through himself. Both sides of fire's majestic power - both it's destructiveness, and it's ability to purify - are in evidence. Firstly, this spell deals 15d6 fire damage (save vs. spells for half) to all foes within 30 feet of the caster. This does not affect party members. Secondly, the caster's body is purified by the holy flames, as per the effects of a Heal spell.

They also wear black iron gauntlets with glowing green eyes painted on the back of the hand. These gauntlets are actually the priests' holy symbols of Xvim.

Disadvantages:

@11811 = ~Less than a fortnight after becoming vermin in the following of Iyachtu Xvim, you were summoned before the Ruinlord of your temple. In a brief, if somewhat cold meeting, you were assigned your first duty as an Authlim: to make a pilgrimage to the North and see if you could gather more stength for the Cruel Master from the frontier towns. Almost as an afterthought, he mentioned portents and omens concerning events transpiring in the North that might be of interest to Iyachtu Xvim; it was the belief of the temple that a representative of the Godson might serve to exploit the potential troubles in the region.

Though these pilgrimages are often considered an unwanted duty by the more politically minded clergymen of your order, you found yourself eager to accept the task. It seemed to be a chance to do the Cruel Master’s will in a practical way, an opportunity to escape the routine of following fruitless leads from your temple superiors. Without hesitation, you agreed to make the pilgrimage, and within a tenday you set out on your journey, armed only with a staff in your hand and power on your mind.~
@11812=~While consorting with the followers of Xvim fills me with some trepidation, I feel I have no choice in this matter. As a servant of order, albeit a twisted one, I would call on you for your aid.~

Deneir and Milil both act as intercessors for Oghma, carrying new information both to him and to those whom Oghma favors.

Oghma's followers believe that knowledge is most supreme, particularly in its raw form, the idea. An idea has no weight but can move mountains. It has no height but it can dominate a nation. It has no mass but it can push aside empires. Knowledge is the greatest tool of humankind, outweighing anything made by mortal hands. Before anything can exist, the idea must exist.

@12401 =~Heartwarder of Sune~
@12402 =~HEARTWARDER OF SUNE: Sune (pronounced: sue-nee) Firehair is said to be the fairest of all the powers. When she is represented, she is shown as the most beautiful woman in the Realms, with sweeping, radiant, red hair and incredible charms. The Sunite faith is a popular one in large metropolitan areas and among the nobility. Those of a literary or artistic bent, as well as people falling in love or looking for lifemates, often venerate the Lady Firehair.

Sune herself is said to be benevolent and sometimes whimsical, alternating between deep passions and shallow flirtations. She has been romantically linked with many of the Faerunian powers in the myths of the Realms, though she has never shown any love at all for the gods of fury, Talona, or Tempus, since their functions posit the destruction of many beautiful things, both living and inanimate. Currently, she is rumored to have been rather smitten by the noble actions of Torm at Tantras during the Time of Troubles.

Sune's speciality priests, known as Heartwarders of Sune, are aesthetes and hedonists who actively seek out pleasure and beauty in all things, and who nurture the creation of beautiful objects.  They are typically found in large cities in the company of the cultural elite.  Most are active patrons of the arts, and all play the role of matchmaker for persons in all levels of society.  Many are employed as artists, crafters, performers, or instructors, though a few travel the world to promote beauty and love.

Elven lore states that the Fair Folk sprang from drops of blood Corellon shed in epic battles with Gruumsh mingled with Sehanine's (or Angharradh's) tears. The Creator of the Elves embodies the highest ideals of elvenkind, and he is the patron of most aesthetic endeavors, including art, magic, music, poetry, and warfare. He is venerated by all the Fair Folk, except the drow and those who have turned to Lolth, Ghaunadaur, Vhaeraun, and other dark powers. Corellon is especially popular with elf and half-elf mages, musicians, and poets.

Ceremonial vestments for priests of Corellon consist of azure robes made of gossamer and embroidered with silver quarter moons. Silver circlets engraved with the Protector's symbol are worn on the brow. The holy symbol of the faith is a silver or mithral lunate pendant worn on a slender chain hung from the neck. When adventuring, Corellon's priests generally favor traditionally elven equipment in conscious imitation of their divine patron.

He drinks the tears of disillusioned dreamers and broken-hearted lovers. He is not above an alliance with another deity as long as he thinks he can betray the other divine power and come out ahead.

Cyric's church is pledged to spread strife and work murder everywhere in order to make folk believe in and fear the Dark Sun. It supports cruel rulers and indulges in intrigue in such a way that the world won't be overrun by wars (and thus fall under the sway of Tempus). His church is often beset by internal feuds and backstabbing, but this conflict has decreased in recent years as Cyric has gained better control of himself and has consolidated the churches of the deities whose portfolios he took over.

@13013= ~Things are starting to resolve themselves, and there's only a bare few of the spawn left.  Bhaalspawn like yourself... very powerful, very resourceful mortals.  Like I once was.  You can imagine my concern, hm?~
@13014= ~You think I will challenge you for the portfolio of Murder.~

@13020= ~I have nothing to say.  You know me, and can form your own conclusions.~
@13021= ~Lies and deception... that is my portfolio, and that is all I expect from my followers.  I wouldn't have it any other way.  Unfortunately, though, you have outgrown yourself.~
@13022= ~I cannot destroy you personally, but I can enforce the means to the end.  From now on, you may rest assured that your calls in battle will go unanswered.~
@13023= ~Lies and deception... that is my portfolio, and that is all I expect from my followers.  I wouldn't have it any other way.~
@13024= ~If you get far enough, I will grant you the realm of Murder, and you will sit as my ally.  It is not a position that has lasted well in the past, but perhaps you can change that.  In any case, rest assured that the moment you betray me even Ao will not prevent me stripping it from you.~
@13025= ~So, <CHARNAME>, *are* you worthy of my favour?  Through strife we learn our true merit; time, I think, to test your mettle against some of my other servants.  Perhaps we will meet again.  I suggest you prepare yourself.~
@13026= ~You know who I am, of course.  You feel my gaze as you pray at night.~

@20302 =~oozemaster~
@20303 =~Oozemaster~
@20304 =~OOZEMASTER DRUID: Seeping out of every crack and crevice in the dungeon is some foul, monochromatic substance that adventurers wish wasn't there. Just when they get around the yellow mold, green slime drips from the ceiling. Quite often, such abominations well up naturally, but occasionally they are placed by a more deliberate hand--that of the oozemaster.

The oozemaster is not a class for stable individuals. It involves relating one-on-one with things that relate to nothing at all. Unlike the kindred creatures of most druids, the oozemaster's charges have nothing to say. No one has yet developed a Speak with Ooze spell--or if someone has, the oozes haven't responded. Given that oozemasters exude everything but confidence, most of them have few sentient friends and even fewer guests. Thus, they tend to gibber and talk to themselves a lot.

There are, however, substantial rewards to pursuing the path of the oozemaster. As their powers develop they find themselves taking on many of the characteristics of their favored creatures, although they become increasingly alien of mindset and find it harder to relate to others. By this point, though, they tend not to see this as much of a disadvantage.

Advantages:
- May use a Paralytic Touch attack once per day per 5 levels.
This spell functions in the same manner to the second level mage spell Ghoul Touch
- From level 3, the oozemaster's alien metabolism renders them immune to disease
- From level 5, the oozemaster's alien metabolism makes them immune to poison
- From level 7, may shapeshift to the form of a mustard jelly. This ability is useable 3 times per day
- From level 9, oozemasters become immune to acid
- From level 15, oozemasters become immune to blindness, sleep, paralysis, stunning and critical hits as they become one with the ooze and lack a discernable internal anatomy

Disadvantages:
- Do not gain other standard druidic special abilities (such as shapeshifting into wolves or bears, or the elemental resistance gained at high levels)
- Suffers a -1 penalty to Charisma at levels 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 15 as they become increasingly separated from a humanoid mindset and their features continue to distort~

@40301 = ~bowslinger~
@40302 = ~Bowslinger~
@40303 = ~BOWSLINGER: The Bowslinger is the epitome of elven skill with the bow.  If there is a difficult shot to make, he will make it.  Whether the target can only be reached by firing through high winds or is totally concealed, the Bow Slinger is confident of his ability to make the shot.

Advantages:
- +1 THAC0 and damage with any missile weapon for every three levels of experience, slowing to every five levels once the bowslinger reaches 18th level
- Can achieve high mastery (four points) in bows
- May use the 'Called Shot' ability once a day per four levels (starting at 4th level).  When the bowslinger activates this ability, any shot made within the next 20 seconds gains +1 to both THAC0 and damage for every four levels of experience
- May use the 'Speed Shot' ability once a day per eight levels (starting at 8th level).  When the bowslinger activates this ability, he makes one extra attack per round for five rounds
- May cast 'Detect Invisibility' once a day per six levels (starting at 6th level)

Disadvantages:
– Race restricted to elf and half-elf.
- Does not gain 'Charm Animal' as an innate ability
- -1 to damage with any melee weapon
- Can only become proficient (one point) in long swords, short swords and daggers
- Can not even be proficient in any other melee weapon
- Cannot wear any metal armor~

@40601 = ~feralan~
@40602 = ~Feralan~
@40603 = ~FERALAN: What happens to children who wander in the wilderness and are never recovered? Or worse, those who are abandoned there? Many succumb to the dangers of the wild, but a fortunate few are taken in by animals, raised as a part of a lion`s brood, or a wolf`s litter. Cut off from civilization, they gradually take on the characteristics of the creatures who adopted them, forming some kind of unity with the spirit of the wild. In the process they become feralans, beings who combine the savagery of beasts with the intellect of man.

Feralans cannot be Lawful Good.

Advantages:
- +10% to stealth
- +1 to Armor Class for every 5 levels of experience (starting at 1st level)
- May use the 'Feral Rage' ability once a day per 10 levels.  The enraged state lasts for 60 seconds, and grants a bonus of +2 to hit, damage, and AC, and immunity to charm, hold and fear, maze, imprisonment, stun and sleep.  He also gains 15 temporary hit points
- May use the 'Call of the Wild' ability once a day.  This unique ability summons an animal companion who will fight for the caster for 3 rounds + 1 round/level.  More powerful creatures are summoned at higher levels.

Disadvantages:
- Becomes winded after Feral Rage. While he's winded he receives -2 to hit, -2 to damage and a +2 penalty to armor class
- Can only become proficient (one point) in bastard swords, long swords, short swords, two-handed swords, katanas, scimitars, halberds, flails and crossbows
- Cannot wear any armor
- Maximum Charisma is 2 points lower than a standard member of the race~

@40901 = ~forest runner~
@40902 = ~Forest Runner~
@40903 = ~FOREST RUNNER: Wherever a corrupt or oppressive regime holds power, there's bound to be a Forest Runner. Forest Runners rise in opposition to such regimes, living on the fringes of society, usually one step ahead of the law. They're criminals only in a technical sense, as they adhere to a personal code that compels them to wage war against greedy aristocrats and unjust rulers. While the powers-that-be view the Forest Runner as a lawless troublemaker, commoners see him as hero, perhaps their best hope against a tyrannical government.

Forest Runners cannot be Lawful Good.

Advantages:
- +5% to stealth
- Can achieve mastery (three points) with long bows, quarterstaffs, long swords, and daggers
- May use the 'Inspire' ability once a day per six levels (starting at 1st level).  This unique ability boosts the morale and attack rolls of the Forest Runner's companions for 3 rounds.

Disadvantages:
- May not wear any metallic armor
- Can only become proficient (one point) in axes, two-handed swords, warhammers, and crossbows~

@41201 = ~justifier~
@41202 = ~Justifier~
@41203 = ~JUSTIFIER: Some expeditions are so demanding and some foes so dangerous that they require the attention of a highly trained specialist whose combat skills far exceed those of the typical ranger. Enter the Justifier, a master tactician whose military instincts, fighting versatility, and steely nerves places him in the first rank of elite warriors.

For a determined Justifier no job is too difficult, no enemy too formidable. Their proficiency with weapons gives them an edge in combat, though the smaller time devoted to magical training leaves them slightly lacking in that department.

Justifiers must be Lawful Good.

Advantages:
- +10% to stealth
- +1 to hit and +1 to speed factor for every 10 levels of experience

Disadvantages:
- Does not gain 'Charm Animal' as an innate ability
- Spell casting ability limited to:
'Cure Light Wounds' and 'Armour of Faith' once each per day from level 8
'Luck' and 'Remove Fear' once each per day from level 10
'Draw Upon Holy Might' once per day from level 12~

@41501 = ~wilderness runner~
@41502 = ~Wilderness Runner~
@41503 = ~WILDERNESS RUNNER: There are rangers, and then there are rangers.  Elves are uniquely connected with the rhythms of the forests, some more deeply than others.  Only those who have chosen to become rangers may elect to become more fully part of the forest, casting aside the trappings of even elven society to serve the needs of the wood.  They are called wilderness runners.

Advantages:
- +10% resistance to non-magical fire and cold
- Can achieve mastery (three points) in long bows and quarterstaffs
- May use the 'Enhanced Charm Animal' ability once a day per two levels (starting at 1st level). This unique ability replaces 'Charm Animal', lasting twice as long and affecting all animals in the vicinity
- Can set snares (starts at 20% and improves by 5% per level)

Disadvantages:
– Race restricted to elf.
- May not wear any armor greater that studded leather
- Can only become proficient (one point) in flails, morningstars and warhammers
- Maximum Charisma is 2 points lower than a standard member of the race~
@41504 = ~Enhanced Charm Animal~
@41505 = ~Enhanced Charm Animal

Range: visual sight
Duration: 4 turns
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: All animal in the area
Saving Throw: Negates effect

This ability affects any animal it is cast upon. The animals are allowed a save vs. spell to negate the effect. If the ability's recipient fails its Saving Throw, it regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give it orders, and the charmed animal will carry them out as quickly as possible. If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed animal by some overt action, or if a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon the charmed animal, the ability is broken. If two or more charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence. Note that the subject will be hostile when the charm expires, regardless of its original attitude. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where it was charmed.~
